                            <p class="text-lg">
                                My name is Sari, and I never intended to become a peacemaker. I just wanted to make good coffee and earn enough money to support my family. But sometimes, life has other plans for you.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I opened my small warung kopi in Lhokseumawe in 2005, just a few months after the peace agreement was signed between the Indonesian government and GAM (Free Aceh Movement). The conflict had torn our community apart for nearly thirty years. Neighbors had stopped talking to each other. Families were divided. Trust was a luxury we couldn't afford.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                My coffee shop was nothing special - just a few plastic tables and chairs under a corrugated metal roof, with a small kitchen where I brewed coffee using beans from the mountains of Gayo. But it was located at the intersection of two neighborhoods that had been on opposite sides during the conflict. Without realizing it, I had placed my little business right in the middle of a invisible battlefield.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                In the first few weeks, I noticed something strange. People would come to buy coffee, but they would look around nervously before sitting down. Some would leave immediately if they saw certain other customers. Others would sit as far away from each other as possible, even though my warung was small.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I realized that my customers were former combatants, government supporters, and GAM sympathizers - people who had been enemies just months before. They were all trying to return to normal life, but they didn't know how to be in the same space together.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The breakthrough came on a rainy Thursday morning in October. Two men arrived at almost the same time - Pak Ahmad, who had been a local government official during the conflict, and Bang Yusuf, who everyone knew had supported GAM. They both wanted coffee, but neither wanted to sit near the other.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I was getting frustrated with this silent tension that was affecting my business. So I did something that surprised even myself. I brought them both their coffee and sat down at their table without being invited.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                "Gentlemen," I said, "this is a coffee shop, not a battlefield. The war is over. If you want to keep fighting, please do it somewhere else. But if you want good coffee, you're welcome to stay and act like civilized human beings."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                They both looked shocked. No one had spoken to them so directly since the peace agreement. For a moment, I thought they might both leave. Instead, Bang Yusuf started laughing. "The lady has a point, Ahmad," he said. "We're both too old to keep carrying grudges."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Pak Ahmad smiled reluctantly. "I suppose we are," he replied. "And this is very good coffee."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                That was the beginning. They didn't become best friends overnight, but they started acknowledging each other. A nod here, a "good morning" there. Other customers noticed. Slowly, the atmosphere in my warung began to change.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I started implementing what I called "coffee diplomacy." When I noticed tension between customers, I would bring them both coffee and sit with them for a few minutes, steering the conversation toward safe topics - the weather, the quality of the coffee beans, local news that had nothing to do with politics.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I also established some simple rules: No political discussions during morning coffee hours (7-9 AM). No raised voices ever. Anyone who wanted to argue about the past had to buy coffee for everyone else in the shop. That last rule was particularly effective - nobody wanted to spend that much money on an argument.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Gradually, something beautiful began to happen. People started coming not just for the coffee, but for the company. Former enemies began sharing tables. They discovered they had common concerns - their children's education, the rising price of rice, the condition of the roads.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                One day, Pak Ahmad mentioned that his son was struggling with mathematics in school. Bang Yusuf, who had been a teacher before the conflict, offered to help tutor the boy. That small act of kindness created a ripple effect. Soon, people were helping each other with various problems - sharing job opportunities, lending tools, even organizing community clean-up days.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The real test came during Ramadan in 2006. I decided to keep the warung open for sahur (pre-dawn meal) and iftar (breaking fast). I was worried that the religious atmosphere might reopen old wounds, since religion had been used to justify positions during the conflict.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Instead, the opposite happened. People from both sides came together to break their fast. They shared food, told stories, and prayed together. I realized that their shared faith was stronger than their political differences.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                By 2007, my little warung had become something I never expected - a symbol of reconciliation in our community. Local newspapers wrote articles about it. Peace activists visited to see how "coffee diplomacy" worked. I even received a small grant from an NGO to expand the space and add more tables.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                But the most meaningful recognition came from my customers themselves. They started calling my place "Warung Damai" - the Peace Coffee Shop. They brought their families, their friends from other neighborhoods, even visitors from other cities.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Today, nearly twenty years later, my warung is still here. Some of my original customers have become close friends. Their children, who grew up seeing former enemies share coffee and conversation, don't understand why their parents ever fought each other. To them, diversity of opinion is normal, and conflict resolution happens over a cup of coffee.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-800">
                                I learned that peace isn't just the absence of war - it's the presence of understanding, respect, and shared humanity. Sometimes, all it takes is a neutral space, good coffee, and someone willing to say, "The war is over. Let's talk about something else."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                My warung kopi taught me that ordinary people can do extraordinary things for peace. We don't need to be diplomats or politicians. We just need to create spaces where people can remember that they are neighbors first, and everything else second.
