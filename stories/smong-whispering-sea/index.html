                                My name is Nenek Aminah, and I am 78 years old. I am one of the last keepers of the Smong tradition on Simeulue Island. For generations, my family has passed down the ancient warnings that have saved countless lives from the angry sea.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Smong is not just a story - it is our survival guide, our early warning system, our connection to the wisdom of our ancestors. The word "smong" comes from our local language and means "tsunami." But it represents so much more than just a word. It represents the accumulated knowledge of hundreds of years of living with the sea.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The Smong tradition began long before any of us were born. Our ancestors lived through many great waves, and those who survived learned to read the signs that the sea gives before it becomes angry. They turned this knowledge into songs, stories, and sayings that could be easily remembered and passed down to children.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The most important Smong teaching is simple: "If the earth shakes strongly and the sea water recedes, run immediately to high ground." This knowledge saved almost everyone on our island during the great tsunami of 2004, while other places that had forgotten their traditional warnings lost many lives.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I learned Smong from my grandmother when I was just seven years old. She would sit with me and my cousins under the old banyan tree near our house and tell us the stories. But these weren't just bedtime stories - they were lessons that could save our lives.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                "Listen carefully, little ones," she would say. "The sea is like a person with moods. Most of the time, it is calm and gives us fish and safe passage. But sometimes, when the earth beneath it becomes angry and shakes, the sea becomes angry too. When this happens, the sea will first pull back, as if taking a deep breath. Then it will return with all its fury."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                She taught us the signs to watch for: the unusual retreat of the sea, exposing coral reefs and fish flopping on the sand. The strange sound - like a freight train or thunder that doesn't stop. The way animals behave differently - dogs barking frantically, birds flying inland, even insects becoming agitated.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                But the most important lesson was about time. "When you see these signs," my grandmother would say, "you don't have time to think, to pack, to say goodbye. You have time only to run. Run to the hills, and don't stop until you are high above the highest tide you have ever seen."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The Smong tradition also taught us about the waves themselves. "The first wave is not always the biggest," my grandmother explained. "Sometimes the second or third wave is the most dangerous. Stay on high ground until the sea has been calm for many hours."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                When I was young, I sometimes wondered if these old stories were really necessary. We had radios, and later television. Surely modern technology would warn us of any danger? But my grandmother was wise. "Technology can fail," she said. "Radios can break, electricity can stop working. But the sea will always give the same signs, and your eyes and legs will always work."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The truth of her words became clear on December 26, 2004. I was visiting my daughter in the main village when the great earthquake struck. The shaking was so strong that we could barely stand. But immediately, the Smong knowledge kicked in.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                "Smong!" I shouted to everyone around me. "The sea will come! Run to the hills!" Some people looked at me strangely - an old woman shouting about ancient stories. But others, especially the older residents who remembered the teachings, began to run.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                We didn't wait to see if the sea would actually retreat. The earthquake was strong enough and long enough that Smong wisdom told us to assume the worst. We ran to the hills behind the village, and from there we watched as the sea pulled back further than anyone had ever seen, then returned as a wall of water that swept away everything in its path.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Because of Smong, Simeulue Island lost only seven people out of 78,000 residents during the 2004 tsunami. Compare this to other places where thousands died because they didn't know the signs or didn't know to run immediately.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                After 2004, many people became interested in Smong. Scientists came to study our traditional knowledge. Government officials wanted to incorporate Smong teachings into official disaster preparedness programs. International organizations asked us to share our wisdom with other coastal communities.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                This attention was good, but it also worried me. I was afraid that in trying to make Smong "scientific" or "official," we might lose its essential character. Smong works because it is simple, memorable, and actionable. It doesn't require equipment or training - just the willingness to listen to the wisdom of our ancestors and act quickly when the signs appear.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Today, I continue to teach Smong to my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. But I also teach it to visitors, to researchers, to anyone who will listen. The knowledge is too important to keep only within our community.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I tell them that Smong is not just about tsunamis. It represents a way of thinking about disaster preparedness that combines careful observation of nature, respect for traditional knowledge, and the importance of community education. It shows that the wisdom of indigenous peoples can complement and enhance modern science.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800">
                                The sea will always be with us, and sometimes it will be angry. But if we remember the lessons of our ancestors, if we teach our children to read the signs and act quickly, if we respect both traditional wisdom and modern knowledge, we can live safely beside the sea for many more generations.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                This is the gift of Smong - not just the knowledge of when to run, but the understanding that survival depends on community, memory, and the courage to act on ancient wisdom even in modern times.
