                            <p class="text-lg">
                                My name is Daud, and I serve as the head of our village disaster preparedness committee in Calang. What I'm about to tell you happened on October 15, 2019 - a night that tested everything we had learned about community-based disaster response since the 2004 tsunami.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                It had been raining heavily for three days straight. Not unusual for October in Aceh, but this rain was different. It was relentless, drumming on our metal roofs with an intensity that made conversation difficult. By evening, the small river that runs through our village had risen significantly, but still within what we considered normal flood levels.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I went to bed around 11 PM, but I couldn't sleep. Something felt wrong. Maybe it was the sound of the rain - it seemed to be getting heavier instead of lighter. Maybe it was the way the wind had picked up, howling through the trees with an urgency I hadn't heard before. Or maybe it was just the instinct that comes from living through disasters and learning to read the signs.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                At 1:30 AM, my phone rang. It was Ibu Siti, one of our volunteer monitors who lives upstream near the forest. Her voice was tight with worry. "Pak Daud," she said, "you need to see this. The river is rising very fast. Much faster than normal. And there's debris coming down - big logs, even parts of houses from the villages upstream."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I threw on my rain gear and grabbed my flashlight. The rain was so heavy I could barely see three meters ahead. I made my way to the river, and what I saw made my blood run cold. The water level had risen at least two meters in just the past hour. But more alarming was the sound - not just the rush of water, but the grinding, crashing noise of debris being carried downstream.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                This was exactly what we had trained for. After the 2004 tsunami, our community had worked with disaster management agencies to develop an early warning system for various types of floods. We had learned that flash floods could be just as deadly as tsunamis, especially at night when people are sleeping and can't see the danger approaching.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I immediately activated our emergency protocol. First, I called the other committee members - five people strategically located throughout the village. Each of them had a list of families to contact and specific evacuation routes to coordinate. We had practiced this dozens of times, but never in the middle of the night during a real emergency.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Next, I activated our community alarm system. We had installed a series of air horns and bells throughout the village, each with a specific pattern that residents had been trained to recognize. Three long blasts meant "flash flood warning - evacuate immediately to high ground."
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The sound of those horns cutting through the rain and darkness was both terrifying and reassuring. Terrifying because it meant real danger was imminent. Reassuring because it meant our system was working, and people would know what to do.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Within minutes, I could see flashlights and lanterns moving throughout the village as families began their evacuation. We had designated three evacuation sites on higher ground - the elementary school, the mosque, and a community center. Each family knew which site to go to based on their location, and each site had emergency supplies pre-positioned.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                But evacuating 200 families in the middle of the night during a storm is not simple. There were elderly people who needed assistance, small children who were frightened and confused, and people with disabilities who required special help. This is where our community training proved invaluable.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Each neighborhood had designated "helpers" - usually young, strong adults who were responsible for assisting vulnerable residents. Pak Ahmad, a fisherman, carried 80-year-old Nenek Fatimah on his back through the flooding streets. Ibu Maryam, a teacher, organized the children at the evacuation center, turning the scary situation into a "camping adventure" to keep them calm.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                By 2:30 AM, most families had reached the evacuation sites. But we weren't done yet. Our monitoring team continued to track the flood's progress, and what they reported was worse than we had feared. The flash flood was carrying not just water, but a massive amount of debris - trees, rocks, parts of buildings from upstream villages.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                At 2:45 AM, the flood hit our village with full force. From our position at the school, we could hear the roar of water and the crash of debris smashing into houses. The sound was terrifying - like a freight train mixed with the noise of a construction site being demolished.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                When dawn broke, we could see the extent of the damage. The flood had swept through the lower part of our village, destroying 15 houses completely and damaging dozens more. Cars had been tossed around like toys. The small bridge that connected our village to the main road was gone, swept away by the force of the water.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                But here's the remarkable thing: not a single person was seriously injured. Not one life was lost. Two hundred families had been safely evacuated in less than an hour, in the middle of the night, during one of the worst storms in recent memory.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The success of our response wasn't due to luck or advanced technology. It was the result of years of preparation, community education, and the hard-learned lessons from the 2004 tsunami. We had learned that disasters don't wait for convenient times, and that communities must be prepared to save themselves.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Our early warning system combined traditional knowledge with modern communication. The upstream monitors who watched for rising water levels were using techniques passed down from their grandparents, but they communicated via mobile phones and WhatsApp groups. The evacuation routes had been planned using GPS mapping, but they incorporated local knowledge about which paths stayed dry during floods.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                In the days that followed, as we began the cleanup and recovery process, I reflected on what had made our response so effective. It wasn't just the systems and procedures - it was the trust and cooperation that had been built over years of working together.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                People followed the evacuation orders not because they were forced to, but because they trusted the judgment of their neighbors. Families helped each other not because it was required, but because they had practiced doing so and understood that everyone's safety depended on everyone else's cooperation.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-800">
                                The flash flood of October 2019 taught us that disaster preparedness is not just about having plans and equipment - it's about building communities where people look out for each other, where traditional wisdom is combined with modern knowledge, and where everyone understands their role in keeping the community safe.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Today, our village is often visited by disaster management officials from other regions who want to learn about our community-based early warning system. We're always happy to share what we've learned, because we know that disasters don't respect boundaries. The more communities that are prepared, the safer we all are.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The most important lesson from that midnight flood is this: you can't wait for disaster to strike before you start preparing. Preparation must happen during calm times, when people have the time and energy to learn, practice, and build the relationships that will save lives when the storm comes.
