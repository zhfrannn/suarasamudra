                                Three months after the tsunami swept away our village in Meulaboh, we stood in a circle where our community center once stood. The ground was still muddy, scattered with debris that the cleanup crews hadn't reached yet. But we weren't waiting for someone else to rebuild our lives - we were here to do it ourselves.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                I am Pak Rahman, and I had been the village head for fifteen years before the wave came. In those first weeks after the disaster, I felt lost. How do you lead a community when there's no community left to lead? Our houses were gone, our mosque was destroyed, our school was nothing but a concrete foundation. Many families had been separated, some had lost everything, and others had moved away to live with relatives in other cities.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                But slowly, people started coming back. First, it was just a few families living in tents provided by relief organizations. Then more returned, drawn by the same thing that had always held our community together - the bonds we had built over generations. We realized that while the tsunami had taken our buildings, it couldn't take away our gotong royong spirit.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Gotong royong - it's more than just working together. It's the understanding that your neighbor's wellbeing is connected to your own. It's the knowledge that when one family struggles, the whole community feels it. And when one family succeeds, we all celebrate together.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                We started with the basics. Every morning at 7 AM, we would gather at what used to be the village center. We'd discuss what needed to be done that day. Should we focus on clearing more debris? Building temporary shelters? Digging a new well? The decisions were made together, and the work was shared by everyone who was able.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The children helped too. While the adults worked on construction, the kids would sort through salvaged materials, separating what could be reused from what needed to be discarded. The elderly, even those who couldn't do heavy labor, contributed by cooking meals for the work crews and sharing their knowledge about where things used to be located.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                One of our biggest debates was about what to rebuild first. Some said we needed houses - people were tired of living in tents. Others argued for the mosque, saying we needed a spiritual center to give us strength. A few insisted on the school, because our children's education couldn't wait.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                After many discussions, we decided on the school. Not because houses and the mosque weren't important, but because the school represented our future. It was a statement that we believed our community would not just survive, but thrive again. It was hope made concrete.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Building that school took six months. We had limited resources - some donated materials, some salvaged from the ruins, and a lot of creativity. But what we lacked in materials, we made up for in determination. Fathers who had been fishermen learned carpentry. Mothers who had been housewives learned masonry. Teenagers learned to mix cement and lay bricks.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The day we opened the school was one of the happiest days of my life. It wasn't the most beautiful building - the walls were a bit crooked, the paint job was uneven, and the desks were mismatched pieces we had cobbled together. But when I saw our children walking through those doors, laughing and playing in the courtyard we had built with our own hands, I knew we had accomplished something extraordinary.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                The international aid organizations were amazed by what we had achieved. They had expected to find a community waiting for help, but instead they found a community that had already begun helping itself. They offered to rebuild our school with better materials and professional contractors, but we politely declined. This school was ours - built by our hands, with our sweat, carrying our dreams.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Over the next two years, we rebuilt everything - houses, the mosque, shops, even a small health clinic. Each project brought us closer together. Families that had barely spoken before the tsunami became close friends. Young people who had been planning to leave for the city decided to stay and help build something new.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800">
                                Today, our village is stronger than it was before the tsunami. Not just because our buildings are better constructed or because we have improved drainage systems. We're stronger because we rediscovered what it means to be a true community. We learned that gotong royong isn't just about working together - it's about believing in each other, trusting in our collective strength, and never giving up on the idea that together, we can overcome anything.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg">
                                When visitors come to our village now, they often ask about our "secret" to successful recovery. The answer is simple: there is no secret. There is only the ancient wisdom that our grandparents knew - that a community united is stronger than any disaster, and that the best way to rebuild your life is to help rebuild your neighbor's life too.
